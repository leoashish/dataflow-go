// Main runs a package's tests under a WATCHDOG. Every package's main_test.go calls it:
//
//	func TestMain(m *testing.M) { testutil.Main(m) }
//
// Why: a concurrent program with a bug usually does not crash, it HANGS (a goroutine waits for something that never happens),
// and plain `go test` then waits ten minutes before it says anything. This watchdog gives up after 90 seconds (override with
// the environment variable DATAFLOW_TEST_TIMEOUT, e.g. 30s or 5m; multiplied by -count), prints an explanation and the stack of EVERY goroutine --
// which shows exactly where each one is stuck -- and exits. Healthy runs take a few seconds per package.
